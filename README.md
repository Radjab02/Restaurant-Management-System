# Restaurant-Management-System
A simple Restaurant management System that can generate invoices  

The  system was designed to address the problems which maual or traditional restaurants faced such as  
order mix-up due to the fact that orders are taken and written on just a piece of paper.  
Even some cases the waiter could lose that piece of the paper which results in not only slow but also bad services. 

The objectives of our project are:   
- Eliminate the need of waiters taking orders from the papers by creating a restaurant management system  
-	Trace employeeâ€™s effectiveness by recording whatever he / she handles in a day.  
-	Record orders to avoid mix-ups.  
-	Generate accurate and traceable bills.
